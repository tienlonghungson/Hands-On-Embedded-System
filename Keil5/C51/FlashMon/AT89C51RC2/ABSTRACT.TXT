This Flash Monitor Version is configured to use the 
on-chip flash of a AT89C51RC2 and AT89C5131.

With this configuration the following on-chip memory
is allocated: 

C:0x0000 - C:0x6FFF    Flash available for application
C:0x7000 - C:0x7FFF    Flash used by Flash Monitor

X:0x0000 - X:0x02FF    XDATA available for application
X:0x0300 - X:0x03FF    XDATA used by Flash Monitor

The resulting Monitor.HEX file must be programmed into 
the on-chip Flash with the Atmel FLIP utility.
In order to install the Flash Monitor at code address
0x7000, the boot vector must be set to 0x7000.  This is 
done by setting the following values in FLIP.

- select the checkbox BLJB
- set 'Device BSB' to a value other than 0
- set 'Device SBV' to 70 (Hex)
- press the 'Set' button to store these values
