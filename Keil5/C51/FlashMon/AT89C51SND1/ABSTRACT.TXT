This Flash Monitor Version is configured to use the 
on-chip flash of an AT89C51SND1 and AT89C5132.

With this configuration the following on-chip memory
is allocated: 

C:0x0000 - C:0xDFFF    Flash available for application
C:0xE000 - C:0xEFFF    Flash used by Flash Monitor

X:0x0000 - X:0x06FF    XDATA available for application
X:0x0700 - X:0x07FF    XDATA used by Flash Monitor

The resulting Monitor.HEX file must be programmed into 
the on-chip Flash with the Atmel FLIP utility.
In order to boot the Flash Monitor from code address
0xE000, the boot vector must be set to 0xE000.  This is 
done by setting the following values in FLIP.

- select the checkbox BLJB
- set 'Device BSB' to a value other than 0
- set 'Device SBV' to E0 (Hex)
- press the 'Set' button to store these values
