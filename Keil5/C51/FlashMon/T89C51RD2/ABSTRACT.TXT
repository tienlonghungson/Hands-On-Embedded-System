This Flash Monitor Version is configured to use the 
on-chip flash of a T89C51RD2.

With this configuration the following on-chip memory
is allocated: 

C:0x0000 - C:0xDFFF    Flash available for application
C:0xE000 - C:0xFFFF    Flash used by Flash Monitor

X:0x0000 - X:0x027F    XDATA available for application
X:0x0280 - X:0x03FF    XDATA used by Flash Monitor

The resulting Monitor.HEX file must be programmed into 
the on-chip Flash with the Atmel FLIP utility.
In order to install the Flash Monitor at code address
0xE000, the boot vector must be set to 0xE000.  This is 
done by setting the following values in FLIP.

- The BLJB bit in the Hardware Security Byte must be 
  cleared in order to use the boot address of 0xE000.
  This byte can only be modified with a parallel 
  programmer and not with FLIP!
- set 'Device BSB' to a value other than 0
- set 'Device SBV' to E0 (Hex)
- press the 'Set' button to store these values
