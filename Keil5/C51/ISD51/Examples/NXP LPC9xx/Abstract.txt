The ISD51_Demo project for the Philips LPC935/LPC932 shows how to use the
ISD51 In-System-Debugger with flash breakpoints.
 
This example just blinks with one LED on the Keil MCB900 evaluation 
board and echoes all characters on the serial interface.

Note that the ISD51.H file contains configuration options for the
various LPC900 device variants. You need to adapt this file in
order to get the ISD51 working.
