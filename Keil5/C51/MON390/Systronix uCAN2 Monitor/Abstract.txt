How to load the Monitor into the Systronix uCAN2:
=================================================

The µCAN2 has an integrated loader, that is able to load 
the MON390 to RAM.  To perform this load, you have to:

- Connect the board to the PC via the uCAN2 COM1 serial port.
- Open a standard windows terminal emulation, like 'Hyperterminal'.
- Activate the loader on uCAN2, by pressing the LOAD button.
- Type Enter (CR) in the terminal emulation.  This displays:

- Type 'L' and select the file sending option of your terminal emulation.
  Select the file Keil\C51\MON390\Systronix uCAN2 Monitor\MON390.HEX and 
  send it to the board.
- Now you reset the board, to start the MON390.
