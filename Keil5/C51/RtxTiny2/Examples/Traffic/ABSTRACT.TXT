Traffic is a program that controls a traffic light.

The traffic light is timed and lets cars pass during a
specific time period.  There is a pedestrial crossing
button that lets pedestrians cross.  The lights are
connected to Port 2.  You can see this in action using
dScope.

There are several things of interest here:

*  This program uses RTX51 Tiny.  Program initialization
   and operation code are in TRAFFIC.C.  Look for the
   init task to see where everything starts.

*  Serial I/O is interrupt and signal driven.  Look at
   SERIAL.C for the complete, encapsulated module (you
   may want to use this in your programs).

The TRAFFIC program is available in one target:
  Demo-Simulator:  for eval tools in SMALL model for Simulation
  Simulator:       for full tools in SMALL model for Simulation
  MCB900-RUN:      for MCB900 Eval Board in RUN Mode
  EPM900-Emulator: for EPM900 Emulator for target testing

The configuration file Conf_tny.A51 disables the round-robin timeout
and enables the CPU idle mode.

Notes:
- The target Demo-Simulator allows program run with Eval Tools.
- The target Demo-Simulator loads a fixed program image that
  cannot be modified.
- The remaining targets (Simulator, MCB900-RUN, EPM900-Emulator)
  require a full version of the Keil C51 Tool Chain.
