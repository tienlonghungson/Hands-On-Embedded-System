*** IMPORTANT NOTE ***
    Far Memory Support is only available in the PK51 package.
    If you have an CA51, DK51, or Evaluation Package the far memory
    support is not available and this example will not work.

This example shows how you can locate text strings in the constant
far memory.  It contains strings in different languages which is typically
for embedded applications that are using a small text display and that
need to be adaptable to different countries.

The example program uses the new features of C51 Version 6.22 and 
LX51 Linker/Locater Version 3.22 to access up to 1MB constants on
classic 8051 devices.

In this example we are using 16 memory banks for code.  Refer to the 
"Macro Assembler and Utilities" User's Guide, "Chapter 9. Linker/Locater 
- Bank Switching for more information about banking hardware.

C51 provides you with the 'far' and 'const far' memory type that can be 
used to access large memory.  The memory accesses routines are part of the
L51_BANK.A51 configuration file.  The example includes a configured
version of the L51_BANK.A51 file.

In this example we are only using the 'const far' memory type.  The 'far
and 'const far' memory types are handled at LX51 linker/locater level with 
new memory classes:
    HDATA   memory class for the 'banked' xdata memory.
    HCONST  memory class for the 'banked' code memory.

You may use the 'const far' memory banking together with code banking 
to expand the program code memory.
