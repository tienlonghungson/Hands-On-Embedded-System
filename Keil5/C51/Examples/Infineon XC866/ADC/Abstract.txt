The ADC project outputs the voltage on the A/D converter input 
AIN6 (which is the potentiometer on the MCBXC866 Board) as 
binary value to the LEDs on P3.0 - P3.7.


The ADC program is available in different targets:
  Simulator:           runs in software Simulator and uses a simulation
                       script that provides the input

  Target via ULINK:    is configured for debugging with Keil ULINK
