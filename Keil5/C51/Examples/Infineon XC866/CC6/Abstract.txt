The CC6 project uses the Timers and the CAPCOM6 Unit 
of the XC866 device to modulate the LEDs on P3.0 - P3.7.

The CC6 program is available in different targets:
  Simulator:           runs in software Simulator. The Logic Analyzer
                       shows some of the Port 3 output pins. The
                       Performance Analyzer is configured to show
                       execution timing of the interrupt service routines.

  Target via ULINK:    is configured for debugging with Keil ULINK
