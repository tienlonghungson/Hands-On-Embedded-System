The SAMPL517 program uses the additional features of the C517,
C517A and C509 CPU to simulate a Hewlett Packard calculator.
The following calculator features are supported:

+        -        *        /
SIN      COS      TAN      SQRT
LOG      ASIN     ACOS     ATAN
EXP      LOG10


The following source files provide useful 517 routines.

*  GETKEY.C:  This file contains routines to get a char from
   the 517's second serial port.

*  PUTCHAR.C:  This file contains routines to output a char
   to the 517's second serial port.

Note that you need to use the Serial Window #1 since this application
communicates via the serial interface 1 of the device.

The SAMPL517 program is configured for testing with the
uVision simulator.
