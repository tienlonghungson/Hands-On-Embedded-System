*** IMPORTANT NOTE ***
    Far Memory Support is only available in the PK51 package.
    If you have an CA51, DK51, or Evaluation Package the far memory
    support is not available and this example will not work.


The following example program shows you how to use xdata banking with
the Evatronix R8051XC core.

In this example we are using 7 memory banks for xdata variables.
Refer to the "Linker/Locater User's Guide - Bank Switching - Configuration"
for more information.

C51 provides you with the 'far' memory type that can be used to
access large memory.  The memory accesses routines are part of the
XBANKING.A51 configuration file.  The example includes a configured
version of the XBANKING.A51 file.

You may use the 'far' memory banking together with code banking 
to expand the program code memory. 

The 'far' memory type is handled at LX51 linker/locater level with 
the memory class:
    HDATA   memory class for the 'banked' xdata memory.

To configure the LX51 Linker/Locater you the following options
under Options for Target - LX51 Locate:

Disable: Use Memory Layout from Target Dialog.

Enter under User Classes:
XDATA (X:0x0-X:0x7FFF), CODE (C:0x0-C:0x7FFF), 
HDATA (X:0x018000-X:0x01FFFF, X:0x028000-X:0x02FFFF, X:0x038000-X:0x03FFFF, X:0x048000-X:0x04FFFF,
       X:0x058000-X:0x05FFFF, X:0x068000-X:0x06FFFF, X:0x078000-X:0x07FFFF)


The simulator is also configured to simulate xdata banking using the -XB 95 parameter under
Project - Options - Debug - CPU DLL Parameter.

The logical memory regions defined with the linker are mapped to physical memory as shown below:
