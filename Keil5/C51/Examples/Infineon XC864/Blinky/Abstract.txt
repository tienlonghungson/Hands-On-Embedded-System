The Blinky project is a simple program for the Infineon XC864
using the Infineon Easy Kit XC800 Evaluation Board.

It blinks the LEDs prints HELLO to the UART interface.

The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  Simulator:           runs in software Simulator
  Target via ULINK:    is configured for flash download / debugging with Keil ULINK
                       Set the max. JTAG clock to 200 KHz for a reliable communication
  Target via DAS:      is configured for flash download / debugging with the on-board DAS JTAG interface

Note:
Since the XC864 only has 2 pins on port 3, you will only see P3.0 and P3.1 blink. 
All other LEDs are not connected to the XC164 device.
