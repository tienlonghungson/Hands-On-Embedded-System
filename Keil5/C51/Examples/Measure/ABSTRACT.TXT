The MEASURE program uses the analog inputs of the P89LPC935
to implement a datalogger.  This example shows how you can 
use signal functions in uVision to simulate a signal coming
into one of the analog inputs of the P89LPC935 controller.

The MEASURE program is available in different targets:
  Demo-Simulator:  for eval tools in SMALL model for Simulation
  Simulator:       for full tools in SMALL model for Simulation
  MCB900-RUN:      for MCB900 Eval Board in RUN Mode
  EPM900-Emulator: for EPM900 Emulator for target testing

Notes:
- The target Demo-Simulator allows program run with Eval Tools.
- The target Demo-Simulator loads a fixed program image that
  cannot be modified.
- The remaining targets (Simulator, MCB900-RUN, EPM900-Emulator)
  require a full version of the Keil C51 Tool Chain.
