The HELLO program is a very simple program that prints "Hello World"
to the serial port of the LPC9xx controller.  When you can successfully 
build and run this program, you have used the entire toolset including:

The uVision integrated development environment.
The C51 compiler, linker and the uVision simulator/debugger.

This HELLO program is available in several targets:

  Simulator:         for uVision Debugger testing with simulator
  MCB900 - Run:      for MCB900 board in Run Mode
  EPM900 - Emulator: for EPM900 Emulator/Programmer Module

Use the following jumper settings on the MCB900 board:
     RUN: ON    RESET: OFF   PROG: OFF
