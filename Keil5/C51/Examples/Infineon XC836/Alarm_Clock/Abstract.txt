This application example of an alarm clock demonstrates how the user can interact
with the RTC module via the touch pads and LED display on the XC836 Easy Kit 
board.

The touchpads have the following function:
‘*’ (TP12) : Enter/Exit Setup mode
‘#’ (TP9) : Switch submode (Clock, Date, Alarm)
‘0’-‘9’ (TP1-TP8, TP10, TP11): Input digit
‘0’ (TP5) : Turn off buzzer

This application is configured for the on-chip flash of the XC836MT controller.
It must be downloaded before testing or debugging.

For more information, please refer to the Infineon Getting Started manual 
for the EasyKit XC836 board.
