# Hands on Embedded System
</div>

This repo stores source codes when I learned Embedded System at HUST. Most of them are just samples from my teacher. 

Codes for practice classes lie in folder practice, with 5 subdirectory corresponding the 5 practice classes.

## Requirement :
- Proteus
- Keilc 5 (Keilc 4 might be most compatible)
